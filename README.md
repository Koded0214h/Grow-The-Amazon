# 🌳 Grow The Amazon

## 🎯 Our Mission

**Grow The Amazon** is an interactive web platform that bridges digital engagement with real-world environmental impact. For every virtual tree planted on our platform, we commit to planting an actual bean tree, creating a tangible connection between online participation and rainforest restoration.
